# About TYPO3 Tonictypes Core Extension

Build easy and intuitive TCA-powered records with customizable backend forms on the fly without any programming knowledge.
You can create datatypes and select from a list of plugins to display your created records.

This extension is a easy to use data structure builder that saves you a lot of time, because there is no more need of creating an extension for
every need. Great solutions can be done by just a few clicks and fluid templating.

You only need one extension to create a lot of solutions.

Having just one extension to maintain gives you the advantage to
improve your workflows when upgrading TYPO3 versions.

Everything is fully compatible with the TYPO3 core.
